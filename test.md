## Project Name: otsu_segmentation  

## Description:   
- This purpose of this package is to allow a user to select an image of their choice and have it segmented.  
- The segmentation threshold is chosen using the Otsu algorithm.  
- Additionally, the script will output a histogram which shows the pixel distribution of the image in question. Within this histogram, the calculated threshold is clearly indicated.
