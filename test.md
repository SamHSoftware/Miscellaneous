## Description:   
- This purpose of this package is to allow a user to compare the effect of different filters which tend to smooth/blur images. 
- The user selects an image, and the code outputs a montage displaying the effect of each individual filter (listed blow), alongside the segmentation output (with a threshold determined by the Otsu method). 
  - [A gaussian filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_filter#:~:text=In%20electronics%20and%20signal%20processing,as%20it%20has%20infinite%20support) (smooths/blurs image). 
  - [A median filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_filter#:~:text=The%20median%20filter%20is%20a,edge%20detection%20on%20an%20image) (smooths/blurs image). 
  - [A maximum filter](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/MaxFilter.html) (does not smooth/blur image, but yields similar effect).  
  - [A minimum filter](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/MinFilter.html) (does not smooth/blur image, but yields similar effect). 
- For each ```.py``` file provided, there is an accompanying ```.ipynb``` file for those who use JupiterLab.

## How to use the code: 

First, open the RUNME.py file. 

To load in the module functions, use the following code: 
```
# Import functions from the module file. 
from otsu_segmentation_functions import *
```
## Input: 
Upon runnig the following function... 
```
# Function input args: None. 
# Function returns: The file path corresponding to the image selected by the user. 
file_path = file_selection_dialog()
```
... a GUI will appear, whithin which, the user should select the image they which to segment.

The following image is provided as a test input. Within the image, you can see a colony of humans stem cells.  

You can find this image, and others, wihtin [this folder](https://github.com/SamHSoftware/Python/tree/main/Image%20Analysis/otsu_segmentation/img).

## Outputs:

In order to segment the image, and generate the script outputs, run the following code:
```
# Function input arg 1: The file path of the image which needs to be segmented. 
# Function input arg 2: 'True' to display the original image, the histogram and the segmentation output. 'False' to not display the output.
# Function output 1: The value of the threshold calculated by the Otsu algorith.
# Function output 2: A segmented image of type int8, with background = 0, and foreground = 255. 
threshold, segmented_image = otsu_segment(file_path, True)
```

There are three outputs which this script will generate.  

### Output 1: 
The value of the threshold calculated by the Otsu algorith, assigned to ```threshold```.

### Output 2: 
The script will assign the segmented image to ```segmented_image```. This image will be automatically saved.

The name of the image will be the original image's name, with the string '\_segmented' appended to the end of the name. The segmented image will share the file extension held by the original image. 

### Output 3: 
Providing ```arg 2``` is set to ```True```, then the code will display a figure with the original image, a histogram with the distribution of pixel values and the segmented image. The segmentation threshold is determined by the Otsu threshold, the value of which is represented by ther vertical red line on the histogram.

## Testing the ```otsu_segment()``` function 

One can simply run the script named ```test_otsu_segmentation_functions``` and call the function ```test_otsu_segment()```. The outputs are given below. 

```
# Test the function 'otsu_segment()' against the provided output. 
# Function input args: None. 
# Function returns: When no errors are detected, a statement confirming this is printed. When errors are detcted, assertion errors are raised. 
def test_otsu_segment(): 
```

What is tested?  
(1) We check for numerical and shape equality between the segmentation output generated when using 'nuclei.png' to  that of'nuclei_segmented.png'.  
(2) We check for type equality between the segmentation output generated when using 'nuclei.png' to 'nuclei_segmented.png'.  
(3) Ensure that the Otsu threshold calculated for 'nuclei.png' is equal to 93.
